I gave a presentation at Acoustics Sydney 2023 on our <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/154/4_supplement/A182/2924110/Experimental-evaluation-of-bilateral-Ambisonics">latest work</a> on experimental evaluation of bilateral Ambisonics. We discussed the potential of bilateral Ambisonics for synthesizing binaural room transfer functions, with its application to personal sound zones.
