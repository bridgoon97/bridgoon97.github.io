Hello! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [3D Audio and Applied Acoustics (3D3A) Lab](https://www.princeton.edu/3D3A/) at Princeton University, advised by Prof. Edgar Choueiri. I received a B.S. in Physics and a minor in Art History at Peking University in 2019.

I am generally interested in spatial audio processing, including binaural audio reproduction using loudspeakers/headphones and sound field control. My current focus is on building robust and adaptive personal sound zone systems that allow headphone-free binaural audio delivery to multiple listeners. In my spare time, I am also enthusiastic in performing & composing music, and was proudly a member of the [Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk)](https://plork.princeton.edu/). (Here is an [interview](https://mae.princeton.edu/about-mae/spotlight/yue-qiao-enhancing-sound-experience) of me if you are interested to know more!)
